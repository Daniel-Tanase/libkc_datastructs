#### Q: Are you tired of looking for data structures libraries written in C?
#### A: Well, search no more, you just found the one you need! üôÉ

This is an open-source C/C++ library that provides a comprehensive collection of
data structures for efficient programming, offering a wide range of essential
data structures such as vectors, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and more.

It aims to simplify the implementation of data structures in C, providing
developers with reliable and optimized solutions. The library is designed to be
easy to use, well-documented, and thoroughly tested, ensuring reliability and
ease of use.

Using this open-source data structure library, developers can improve the
efficiency and performance of their C-based projects.

## Download and Install

To download and install the `keepcoding` library, follow these steps:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Daniel-Tanase/keepcoding.git
$ cd keepcoding && make all
```

Yep, this is it! You can start using the library.

## Use the library

Because I believe that documenting a project is at least as important as writing
the project's code, I have created a very comprehensive wiki for this repository,
explaining in detail how to integrate your code with the `keepcoding` static
library.

So, head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/Daniel-Tanase/keepcoding/wiki)
to learn more!

## Testing

To compile the tests run `make test`. This command will also run all the tests.

If you want to run a single test, after compilation, all of the executables will
be located inside the `build/bin/test` directory. Simply run the executable with
the same name as the test file that you want to run.

e.g. `./build/bin/test/list`
